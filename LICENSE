They wanted us to change the name when we create a new version,
so what the fuck, let's do this! This is the "OREO PUBLIC LICENSE",
with the same vague etymology as the Oreo Cookie;
this license is also known as the "OH WHAT THE FUCK! PUBLIC LICENSE".

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified
copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long
as the name is changed.
